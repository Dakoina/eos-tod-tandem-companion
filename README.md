# Empire of Storms & Tower of Dawn, a tandem reading companion app
This is a Simple PWA *(Progressive Web App)* tandem reading app for Sarah J Maas's **Empire of Storms** and **Tower of Dawn** books. It's an easy way to track your progress during the tandem read of the two books, without needing to print documents.

This app is based on the many documents and images shared online like  on Reddit.

## What can it do?
Things you can do with the app:
- Click on the current chapter button to continue to the next
- Go back and forth between chapters using the previous and next buttons
- An overview of all the chapters
- Progress bars to track your overall progress and between the two books
- You can also reset your progress

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**:

This app stores data in your browser, so if you happen to switch browsers or something clears your browsers' data, you will of course lose your progress. But if you know where in the book you were, you can just forward 

I do not have the time to test it on other mobile devices, but you can copy the source code or suggest some fixes.

## Why?
Well, I'm a new reader and got to the point were I finished "**Queen of Shadows**", after which one apparantly should read the next two books from Sarah J.M. in tandem, for a better experience. I'm a developer and don't like to make a print out of those documents and lose it continuously. 

Could I read them without printing anything? Yes! 

Could I make an app because I'm a developer? Yes! 

So I did, but I did not want to bother with servers and databases, and not put too much time into it. That's why I created this app with Claude 4 and ChatGPT 4.1 to see how good they had become. Are they perfect? No! There's still a lot to change, verify, test and improve. But after a couple hours with some fine tuning and changing stuff I have a PWA that stores its data inside the browser.

Is the code perfect? Far from, looking at the css & html! But AI did a good enough job and it works as I wanted üòä

**Note (rant)**: it seems that a lot of people are still ignorant about the "AI label"... it's not that AI generates everything perfectly! I still have to write down my use cases, verify the code, do extensive testing etc.. And yes, than my app post got removed on a "certain" reddit, because people still have weird biases around AI stuff... f'ing get educated! You have no idea how much time pro developers have to put into real development!
