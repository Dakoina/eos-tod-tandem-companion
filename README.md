# Empire of Storms & Tower of Dawn, a tandem reading companion app
This is a Simple PWA tandem reading app for Sarah J Maas's Empire of Storms and Tower of Dawn books. An easy way to track your progress during the tandem read of the two books. Click on the current chapter button to continue to the next. In case you accidently clicked the button, you can just use the previous and next buttons. You can also reset it.

This app stores data in your browser, so if you happen to switch browsers or something clears your browsers data, you will of course lose your progress.

I created this app to see how good AI has become, with Claude 4 and ChatGPT 4.1.
